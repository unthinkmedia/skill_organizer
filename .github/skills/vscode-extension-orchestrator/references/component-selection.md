# Component Selection

Use this order of preference:

1. Native VS Code UI components.
2. Custom editors for specialized file editing/viewing.
3. WebViews only when native UI and custom editors cannot meet requirements.

## Native UI

Use for:
- Tree navigation and hierarchy.
- Search/select workflows.
- Commands, status, and settings.

## Custom Editors

Use for:
- Specialized file types.
- Visual or structured editing flows.

## WebViews

Use for:
- Rich data visualization.
- Complex custom layouts or media-heavy interfaces.
- Interactive content impossible with native components.
