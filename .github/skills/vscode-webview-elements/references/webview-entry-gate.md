# WebView Entry Gate

Approve WebView work only if all checks pass:

1. Native UI options were considered and documented as insufficient.
2. Custom editor option was considered where relevant.
3. WebView complexity is justified by UX requirements.
4. Security and accessibility constraints are included in scope.

If any check fails, return to native/custom-editor design.
